## About
______________________________________________________________________

The Online Stage Database is an IMDb-like resource offering information on all your favorite stage performances. For those users with a google account who log in, it doubles as an open, free-content resource (similar to Wikipedia) where anyone can contribute in the creation of performer and production data. At the time of deployment all information on performers and productions has been sourced through Wikipedia and all images through Google Image Search(if not Wikipedia, respectfully).

## Next Steps
______________________________________________________________________

There are a number of ways I would love to expand upon this app, such as:

* Creating a search capability to more easily navigate.
* Establishing a user-to-user social media presence where users can interact, add each other, message, get notifications, etc.
* An element of rating and commenting on productions and performers.
* Integrating performance tracing such that a user can see if there is a show running and how to get ticket information.
* Adding in another model/element as far as theatres and performance halls are concerned.
* The ability to see which user posted or created what (this is something I had functioning before deadline and removed as it was flawed)
